# Middleman Template: ZURB Foundation #

Middleman-Foundation is a [Middleman 3.x](http://middlemanapp.com/) project template with the [Compass](http://compass-style.org) and [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) version of the [ZURB Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

## Installation ##

Make sure to have:

1. ruby
1. git
1. middleman ($ `gem install middleman`)

Clone into ~/.middleman (you'll have to create this directory if it's not already there). You can then use it with the `--template` flag on `middleman init`.

1. $ `git clone git://github.com/axyz/middleman-zurb-foundation.git ~/.middleman/zurb-foundation`

Then create a new project using zurb-foundation template.

1. $ `middleman init my_new_project --template=zurb-foundation`
1. $ `cd my_new_proyect`
1. $ `bundle install`
1. $ `bundle exec middleman`

Now you can start hacking on `source` directory and watch live changes on [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567).
